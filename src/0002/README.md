A file that contains other filesÂ§
============================

Try to find the file `flag.txt` and then find the real flag inside that file.

Start by downloading the file [fcd04e26e900e94b9ed6dd604fed2b64](../target/fcd04e26e900e94b9ed6dd604fed2b64?raw=true) and then try to get the flag.

Check out the hints if you feel a need for them.
