The cat has hidden the flag
============================

This is an introduction to the dbwebb CTF by providing a rather simple CTF to start with.

Can you find the flag?

Start by downloading the file [02249d2846749f65d09a0c74e21c2125](../target/02249d2846749f65d09a0c74e21c2125?raw=true) and then try to get the flag.

A flag looks like this.

> `dbwebb-CTF{some message related to the ctf}`

The flag, for this particular ctf, looks like this:

> `dbwebb-CTF{7h15 15 7h3 f1r57 dbw3bb c7f, 345y hu6h?}`

Just so you know what you are looking for.

Check out the hints if you feel a need for them.
